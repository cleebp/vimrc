# My .vimrc Configuration

This is a simple repo, my personal vimrc is located here. I have been playing with my
settings for some time and everything here I pretty much cant live without.

## Setup Guide

First navigate to your home directory, if you are using SSH then the directory you land in
is fine. Once there, type "vim .vimrc", and this is your vimrc file. If you already have things 
in here then you will have to copy and paste in what you want, but if you have never initialized 
your .vimrc then just copy this whole file in.

Thats it, enjoy!
